This rule provides standards for creating a module:
- Every module should consider the following folders: components, hooks, pages, services and utils (some can be optional if there is no requirement)
- components folder should contain all the components required in the module
- services folder will contain all the services which call the API, the service call should reference "request" function in [api.util.js](mdc:src/common/util/api.util.js)
- hooks will contain all the get requests, like useBlogs, useBlog, useMetric etc, where each hook is mapped to a service call, using react-query
- pages will contain the acutal pages mapping to the routes in /src/pages folder
- utils will contain any helper methods required across the module

- the 'container' module in the modules folder is a special module, which helps us bring all the module into one app, this part contains authentication, sidebar management, kind of stuff.

Keep the modules as independant as possible so that change here don't effect other modules and team members can work independantly
