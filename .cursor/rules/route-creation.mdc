This rule provides standards for creating new routes in web application.

- We are using Next.js pages router not app router
- To create a new route, declare it in ./src/pages folder, following file system based routing
- When a new route is created, we don't write much logic in there, the only responsibility of the route page is to import the respective page from ./src/modules/<respective_module>/pages (respective_module depends on what route we are in) folder and rendering the page, by passing required query params, ref: [index.jsx](mdc:src/pages/workspace/[workspaceId]/altitudes/index.jsx)
- Naming standard for the exported function respresenting a page in route should like SamplePageContainer when importing a SamplePage from some module, as we only pass the query params and some app level props to page.
